          Dragon ball fighterz is a 2D generic fighting game that consists of
          multiple characters from the dragon ball franchise. The game has
          captured the hearts of many fans across the globe with its multiple

            Dragon Ball fighters has a system that lets you play against other
            people online ranging from around the world to your region or
            country. Dragon ball fighterz has a ranking system that rewards BP
            for winning matches and takes bp for losing them.

            This tier list is of season 3.5 meaning the lastest fighter is Super

              The Characters
            </h3>
            <p>
              The characters in dragon ball fighterz are on the tier list. I
              will be adressing some characters indvividually and others as a
              group (example I rank videl a tier mainly because of her reflect
              and viability even though most of the a tier is viable in few
              situations.)This, in no way is a legitamate tier list for dragon
              ball fighterz and while i do take
              <b>SOME</b> notes from the official tier list, this isnt one to
              reference what so ever. Just a disclaimer. Now to the explanation!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>
              A-A+ Tier
            </h4>

            <p>
              In A rank we have the below average characters that are either
              extremeley situational, have bad frame data or arent able to
              compete with whats currently meta.<i
                >A word about freiza. Even though in some cases he may be good
                in other cases he may not stack up against some othwers in the
                teir list. A decent change that could bump him up is to give him
                more time in his golden form or allow him to transform again
                when he powers down.</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              For A+ Tier, these are the characters that are safe to pick-up.
              Most have decent frame data and good mix-up options and others are
              hard to master but have rewarding combos and gameplay for the most
              part.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>
              S Tier
            </h4>
            <p>
              S tier is an amalgam of above decent characters. These few have
              really good gimmicks easy high-damage combos and when played
              correct can lead to an insane character.
              <i
                >*Editors Note* (I honestly thought of bumping jiren up to S+
                mainly because of his mid-high damage routes and his over the
                top counter that can couter everything that isnt a super. Thats
                a <b>WILD</b> thing to do henceforth he is a really good
                character.</i
              >
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>
              S+ Tier
            </h4>
            <p>
              The S+ Teir category is one of over-the-top characters. For
              example the best character in the game (in my opinion) is UI Goku.
              He has crazy combo routes, a command grab, a DP (dragon punch), 2
              counters and an option off a sliding knockdown.
