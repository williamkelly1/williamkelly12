        Dragon Ball fighters has a system that lets you play against other
        people online ranging from around the world to your region or country.
        Dragon ball fighterz has a ranking system that rewards BP for winning
        matches and takes bp for losing them.

        This tier list is of season 3.5 meaning the lastest fighter is Super
        Saiyan 4 Gogeta who is still not ranked.

    <h3>
      <b>The Characters</b>
    </h3>
    The characters in dragon ball fighterz are on the tier list. I will be adressing some characters indvividually and others as a group (example I rank videl a tier mainly because of her reflect and viability even though most of the a tier is viable in few situations.)This, in no way is a legitamate tier list for dragon ball fighterz and while i do take <b>SOME</b> notes from the official tier list, this isnt one to reference what so ever. Just a disclaimer. Now to the explanation!

    <h4>
      <p>
        
      </p>
  A-A+ Tier
    </h4>
    
    <p>In A rank we have the below average characters that are either extremeley situational, have bad frame data or arent able to compete with whats currently meta.<i>A word about freiza. Even though in some cases he may be good in other cases he may not stack up against some othwers in the teir list. A decent change that could bump him up is to give him more time in his golden form or allow him to transform again when he powers down.</i>
      <p>
        For A+ Tier, these are the characters that are safe to pick-up. Most have decent frame data and good mix-up options and others are hard to master but have rewarding combos and gameplay for the most part.

      S tier is a amalgam
