      What Is Dragon Ball Fighterz?
    </h1>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Ranking matches
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dragon Ball fighters has a system that lets you play against other people online ranging from around the world to your region or country. Dragon ball fighterz has a ranking system that rewards BP for winning matches and takes bp for losing them. <b>The premise of the document is to help you chose a decent team to help you gain BP.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This tier list is of season 3.5 meaning the lastest fighter is Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta who is still not ranked. <b>If any new characters do come out, this tier list will be outdated.</b> (I would probably update it about a week after he/she comes out)
